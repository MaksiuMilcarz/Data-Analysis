    "Freshly graduated from a top Dutch university in Limburg, you are hired by the Dutch government to advise on a large-scale “education innovation” initiative code-named \"FIETS\" (Flexibele Innovatie voor Efficiënte Toepassing in Scholing). With higher education facing severe budget cuts, the government is looking for creative solutions to \"do more with less.\" Convinced by the stunning progress in language modeling, officials believe LLMs could help battle growing teacher shortages and reduce costs by automating parts of the education process. Your job description: investigate which LMs might be best suited to plug the gaps without draining the budget!\n",
    "\n",
    "You are handed the results of three LMs on the [“Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300) dataset  to compare. This famous dataset consists of 57 subjects with multiple-choice questions, covering diverse subjects like mathematics, computer science, history, and law. Most providers of state-of-the-art LMs use this dataset to showcase the versatility of their latest models. Unfortunately, the intern responsible for collecting the results, didn’t pay attention during DACS KEN3450: Data Analysis. As a result, the collected datasets are slightly corrupted. Jammer!\n",

    "### A very brief primer on Language Models\n",
    "We studied LLMs in the context of the NLP course but here is a short reminder. Language models (LMs) are sophisticated statistical models designed to understand and generate human-like text. At their core, LMs are trained to predict the most likely continuation of a given input text. For example, given the input \"The cat sat on the,\" an LM might predict \"mat\" as a likely continuation.\n",
    "LMs are trained on vast text samples from various sources, including books, websites, and social media. This extensive training allows them to capture patterns and relationships in language, enabling them to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text across a wide range of topics and styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "While LMs can produce text that appears to be written by intelligent humans, it's important to note that their capabilities can diverge from human intelligence in unexpected ways. They may sometimes generate factually incorrect information or struggle with complex reasoning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two key concepts in understanding LMs are:\n",
    "1. **Tokens**: LMs process text using \"tokens\" rather than individual characters. Tokens can be words, parts of words, or punctuation marks. For example, the sentence \"I love AI!\" might be tokenized as [\"I\", \"love\", \"AI\", \"!\"]. Tokenization is the first step in both training and using an LM.\n",
    "2. **Context**: The input text provided to an LM is called the \"context.\" This context informs the model's predictions or generations. A longer or more specific context often leads to more accurate and relevant outputs.\n",

    "(i) It's hard to say if one model is the best because they have different results on the different datasets. We can see that in df_mmlu model Y has the best mean accuracy, while in df_other it is model X who does. The only consistency is that in both datasets model Z has the worst performance.\n",
    "(ii) It is a bit odd that models X and Y have have quite different results on the different datasets. The datasets might be different in a way that impacts the result of these models. Another thing I noticed was that the standard errors of all models in the other dataset are much bigger than in mmlu."

    "B. From these results we can see that model Y is also biased on both datasets, this time having a much higher accuracy in questions where the answer is D, which constrasts with model X, that had much higher accuracy in answers A. On the other hand, the accuracy of model Z seems stable for all answers in both datasets. This behaviour in models X and Y could be the reason why we saw better results from them earlier compared to model Z. Model X might have performed better in the other dataset simply because that dataset had more A answers, and the other way around for model Y in the mmlu dataset."

In question 2.4, we saw it had 97% accuracy on A questions, but that's just because it spams A even when the answer is actually B, C, or D. On the other hand, its precision on C and D is 100%. This suggests Model X is extremely conservative, it only picks C or D if it is absolutely certain. Otherwise, it defaults to guessing A.\n",
